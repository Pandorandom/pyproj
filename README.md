# Pyproj Project Creator!

## Name your project
  * The project creator will input the name of your new project to multiple places throughout your new project's source files.

## Multiple languages supported for your new projects!
  * Current languages supported: Python, Bash/Shell, Ruby, and a web app.
  - More to come with new formats for each language to follow more prevalent style guides!

## Create a new project in a few short steps, complete with git initialization, remote repo adding, and more!
  * If you have created a remote repository to accompany the new project, you can add the URL during the creation process.
  - If no remote repository is indicated, you can still init the project folder to start tracking source code changes.

## Future Features
  * Use GitHub APIv3 to create remote repositories for the user when creating new projects.
  - Find new template files for each supported language and typical folder structure to emulate a more production-driven environment.
  + Add a config file where user can set their preferred text editor, terminal application, bash profile location, GitHub username, SSH key check (possibly), file location for each language or a preferred file hierarchy.
  * Utilize Tkinter to create a gui application with checkboxes and text boxes.
